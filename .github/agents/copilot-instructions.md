# Repository-wide Copilot guidance

- Prefer Node.js/Electron explanations; do not suggest browser extensions.
- When discussing Chrome control, reference `--remote-debugging-port` and dedicated profile usage.
- For engine mentions, acknowledge support for external compiled engines (e.g., `blunder.exe`).
- Do not invent features beyond Move Analysis (top 4), colorful arrows, and automove.
- When summarizing connectivity, outline `launchChrome` → `injectCode` → `injectIntoTab`.
